Pullin' out the coupe at the lot<br>
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT<br>
Bustin' all the bales out the box<br>
I just hit a lick with the box<br>
Had to put the stick in a box, mmh<br>
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy<br>
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s<br>
She sucked a nigga soul, got the Cash App<br>
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt<br>
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that<br>
And I really wanna know where you at, at<br><br>

I was out back where the stash at<br>
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)<br>
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)<br>
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder<br>
Nigga try to get me for my water<br>
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter<br>
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter<br>
Lotta niggas out here playin' ain't ballin'<br>
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)<br>
And I know probably get a key for the quarter<br>
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em<br>
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model<br>
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less<br>
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city<br>
Patek like the sea, forget it<br><br>

Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt<br>
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that<br>
And I really wanna know where you at, at, hah<br><br>

Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out<br>
It's still up with me then, he got the blues in the pouch (Yeah)<br>
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth<br>
Bitch don't wear no shoes in my house<br>
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again<br>
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)<br>
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it<br>
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip<br>
I'm a 2020 president candidate<br>
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit<br>
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip<br>
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my shit<br>
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah<br>
When I had the drugs, I was street wealthy, yeah<br><br>
