Drop the top and open up the roof now that's a quick stop<br>
Only real diamonds round my pink you got on ring pops<br>

Staying quiet (shhhhh)<br>
Bench players always talkin' and they hatin,'<br>

Name one person who listens you<br>

My eyes always stay red cuz I don't fuck with all that visine<br>
It's a crime scene when I step up in the function<br>
My girl on my back, always swear I'm up to something<br>
Well maybe.. I am, I'm always lyin', she always cryin'<br>
I'm buying, because I'm flyin maybe I'm biased<br>
To gettin money, this shit ain't even funny you a joke tho<br>
